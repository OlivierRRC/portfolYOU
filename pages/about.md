# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I have been teaching myselft programing since the fifth grade. I started with scratch (like every good programmer should) before eventually falling in love with
making games in unity. I kept teaching myself new things untill I was finally old
enough to have programming classes offered at my school. By then I had already taught myself most of what I was learning. Now I'm continuing my learning more formally by attending RRC Polytech for game development.
